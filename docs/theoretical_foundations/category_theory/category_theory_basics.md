# Category Theory Basics

Category theory provides a powerful language for describing mathematical structures and their relationships. In the Symbolic Topological Framework, categories are used to formalize the relationships between physical systems, their properties, and transformations.

## Key Concepts:

### Category
A category $\mathcal{C}$ consists of:
* A collection of objects, denoted $Ob(\mathcal{C})$.
* For every pair of objects $A, B \in Ob(\mathcal{C})$, a collection of morphisms (or arrows) from $A$ to $B$, denoted $Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(A, B)$.
* For every object $A$, an identity morphism $id_A : A \to A$.
* For every three objects $A, B, C$, a composition operation $\circ : Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(B, C) \times Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(A, B) \to Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(A, C)$.

These components must satisfy two axioms:
1.  **Associativity:** For morphisms $f: A \to B$, $g: B \to C$, $h: C \to D$, we have $h \circ (g \circ f) = (h \circ g) \circ f$.
2.  **Identity:** For any morphism $f: A \to B$, $f \circ id_A = f$ and $id_B \circ f = f$.

### Functor
A functor $F: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ between two categories $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ maps:
* Objects of $\mathcal{C}$ to objects of $\mathcal{D}$.
* Morphisms of $\mathcal{C}$ to morphisms of $\mathcal{D}$.
