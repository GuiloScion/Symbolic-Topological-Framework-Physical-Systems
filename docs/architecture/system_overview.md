# System Overview

The Symbolic Topological Framework is composed of several interconnected modules, each handling a distinct aspect of the symbolic and topological modeling of physical systems.

Core Components:

DSL Frontend (src/dsl/): Responsible for parsing user input written in the Domain-Specific Language into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and then compiling it into the Intermediate Representation (IR).

Intermediate Representation (IR) (src/ir/): The central symbolic representation of physical systems. It is designed to be flexible, categorical, and allow for various transformations and optimizations.

Core Physics Engine (src/core_physics/): Handles symbolic representations of physical laws, entities, PDE solvers, invariant discovery, quantum-classical hybridization, and thermodynamics.

Topology Module (src/topology/): Manages sheaf-based encodings, simplicial complexes, and topological analysis.

AI Components (src/ai/): Integrates neural-symbolic AI for tasks like physics-aware transformers and differentiable theorem proving.

Verification Module (src/verification/): Interfaces with formal theorem provers to verify properties and consistency of models.

Control Module (src/control/): Implements meta-learned control policies and game theory for multi-agent systems within the framework.

Simulation Engine (src/simulation/): Provides general simulation capabilities, including time integration and visualization tools.

Data Flow
(Detailed explanation of how data flows between these components will go here. E.g., DSL -> AST -> IR -> Physics/Topology/AI -> Simulation -> Outputs/Visualization)
