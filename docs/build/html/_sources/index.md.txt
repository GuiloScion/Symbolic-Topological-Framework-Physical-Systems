# IMPORTANT: The paths below must EXACTLY match your actual file/folder names
# inside your 'docs/source/' directory, including case sensitivity.
# If a warning from your previous build showed 'tutorials/Tutorial_01/getting_started.md'
# instead of 'tutorials/tutorial_01_getting_started.md', or a sub-folder like
# 'theoretical_foundations/category_theory/category_theory_basics.md',
# you MUST adjust the link here or in the relevant sub-README to match your actual files.

# The API reference will be generated later, so this link is for future use.
