Summary:
This script demonstrates how the full compiler stack can be run on a physics DSL snippet. It includes:

Tokenization

Parsing

Type-checking

Intermediate Representation (IR) generation

It showcases defining physical variables, equations, boundaries, and symmetries using LaTeX-like notation.

Design Rationale:
Meant to serve as a living integration test, documentation demo, and CLI test case. Shows how a real user would write and compile DSL code.
