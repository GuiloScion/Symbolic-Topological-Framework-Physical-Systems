# Unified Symbolic-Topological Framework for Physical Systems

## Abstract

Solving the fundamental challenges in physics and engineering requires not only robust data but also deeper, verifiable theoretical foundations. This project proposes a unified, formal framework that integrates advanced mathematics (algebraic topology, category theory), symbolic reasoning, and cutting-edge artificial intelligence (neural-symbolic AI) to describe, simulate, and reason about physical systems. The aim is to move towards a framework for verifiable scientific discovery, enabling the automatic generation and proof of physical laws and system behaviors.

## Project Vision & Motivation

Traditional scientific computing often relies on numerical simulations that lack formal verification or transparent reasoning. Our framework addresses this by building a bridge between symbolic representations of physical laws, rigorous mathematical structures, and powerful AI methods. We envision a future where complex physical systems can be designed, analyzed, and controlled with formal guarantees.

## Key Features (Current & Planned)

### Phase 1: Formalization of Physical Abstraction (In Progress)
* **Domain-Specific Language (DSL):** A LaTeX-style syntax for defining physical entities (particles, fields), their properties (units, types), and laws (PDEs, symmetries).
* **Categorical Intermediate Representation (IR):** A novel compiler backend that translates DSL constructs into a category-theoretic intermediate representation, enabling rigorous mathematical analysis and transformations.
* **Unit-Aware Type System:** Robust dimensional analysis and type checking to ensure physical consistency.
* **Sheaf-Based Structural Encoding (Planned):** Encoding of local laws and symmetries as sections of sheaves over dynamic topological spaces.
* **Prototype Engine for Discrete Systems (Planned):** Initial simulation and validation of symbolic mass-spring systems.

### Future Phases (Conceptual - Under Development)
* **Phase 2: Symbolic Physical Representation & PDE Engine:** Developing symbolic solvers for field equations and discovering conservation laws.
* **Phase 3: Symbolic Theorem Proving and Neural-Symbolic AI:** Integrating with formal theorem provers (e.g., Coq, Lean) and training physics-aware transformers for verifiable inference.
* **Phase 4: Meta-Learned Control & Game-Theoretic Dynamics:** Synthesizing symbolic control policies for multi-agent physical systems with formal guarantees.
* **Phase 5: Simulation, Visualization & Deployment:** Building an interactive simulation engine, advanced visualization tools, and deploying as an open-source platform.

## Getting Started (Phase 1.1 Demo)

To explore the current DSL compiler, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/GuiloScion/Symbolic-Topological-Framework.git](https://github.com/GuiloScion/Symbolic-Topological-Framework.git)
    cd Symbolic-Topological-Framework/
    ```
2.  **Set up the environment (using Codespaces or locally):**
    * **If using GitHub Codespaces:** The `.devcontainer` configuration will automatically set up the environment and install dependencies.
    * **If running locally:**
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
3.  **Run a basic example:**
    ```bash
    # This command will depend on your specific entry point.
    # For now, it might be running one of your core compiler files directly for testing,
    # or a dedicated 'main.py' you create in src/ or examples/.
    # Example (adjust as per your code's entry point after modularization):
    python src/dsl/parser.py # Or python src/main.py if you make an orchestrator
    ```
    *(You will need to adjust the `python` command above once you decide on your main execution script or example file.)*
